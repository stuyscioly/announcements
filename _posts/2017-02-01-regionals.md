Hello everyone! 
Stuyvesant Science Olympiad is going to once again compete in New York City's Regional competition. We came in 2nd place last year, but I am sure that this year, we can finally claim that prized ~~2nd~~ 1st place trophy!


**A reminder that _ALL FORMS_ are due on Thursday, February 5, 2016**
